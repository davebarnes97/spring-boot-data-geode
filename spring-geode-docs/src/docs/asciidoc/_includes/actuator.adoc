== Spring Boot Actuator

Spring Boot for {apache-geode-name} and {pivotal-gemfire-name} (SBDG) adds {spring-boot-docs-html}/production-ready.html[Spring Boot Actuator]
support and dedicated `HealthIndicators` for {apache-geode-name} and {pivotal-gemfire-name}. Equally, the provided
`HealthIndicators` even work with Pivotal Cloud Cache (which is backed by {pivotal-gemfire-name}) when you push your
Spring Boot applications to Pivotal CloudFoundry (PCC).

Spring Boot `HealthIndicators` provide details about the runtime operation and behavior of your {apache-geode-name}-based
Spring Boot applications. For instance, by querying the right `HealthIndicator` endpoint, you can
get the current hit/miss count for your `Region.get(key)` data access operations.

In addition to vital health information, SBDG provides basic, pre-runtime configuration metadata about the
{apache-geode-name} components that are monitored by Spring Boot Actuator. This makes it easier to see how
the application was configured all in one place, rather than in properties files, Spring configuration, XML, and so on.

The provided Spring Boot `HealthIndicators` fall into three categories:

* Base `HealthIndicators` that apply to all {apache-geode-name}, Spring Boot applications, regardless of cache type
(such as regions, indexes, and disk stores).
* Peer `Cache`-based `HealthIndicators` that apply only to peer `Cache` applications, such as
`AsyncEventQueue`, `CacheServer`, `GatewayReceiver`, and `GatewaySender`.
* `ClientCache`-based `HealthIndicators` that apply only to `ClientCache` applications, such as
`ContinuousQuery` and connection `Pool`.

The following sections give a brief overview of all the available Spring Boot `HealthIndicators` provided for
{apache-geode-name}.

TIP: See the corresponding sample link:guides/boot-actuator.html[guide] and {github-samples-url}/boot/actuator[code]
to see the Spring Boot Actuator for {apache-geode-name} in action.

[[actuator-base-healthindicators]]
=== Base HealthIndicators

This section covers Spring Boot `HealthIndicators` that apply to both peer `Cache` and `ClientCache`,
Spring Boot applications. That is, these `HealthIndicators` are not specific to the cache type.

In {apache-geode-name}, the cache instance is either a peer `Cache` instance (which makes your Spring Boot application
part of a {apache-geode-name} cluster) or, more commonly, a `ClientCache` instance (which talks to an existing cluster).
Your Spring Boot application can be only one cache type or the other and can have only a single instance of
that cache type.

[[actuator-base-healthindicators-cache]]
==== GeodeCacheHealthIndicator

`GeodeCacheHealthIndicator` provides essential details about the (single) cache instance (client or peer) and
the underlying `DistributedSystem`, the `DistributedMember`, and configuration details of the `ResourceManager`.

When your Spring Boot application creates an instance of a peer {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/Cache.html[`Cache`],
the {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/distributed/DistributedMember.html[`DistributedMember`] object represents
your application as a peer member or node of the {apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/distributed/DistributedSystem.html[`DistributedSystem`]. The distributed system is
formed from a collection of connected peers (that is, the cluster), to which your application also has
{apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/GemFireCache.html#getDistributedSystem--[access] --
indirectly, through the cache instance.

This is no different for a `ClientCache`, even though the client is technically not part of the peer/server cluster.
However, it still creates instances of the `DistributedSystem` and `DistributedMember` objects, respectively.

Each object has the following configuration metadata and health details:

When data is inserted or updated and the data matches the criteria specified in the OQL query predicate,
an event is sent to the registered client.

[[actuator-peercache-healthindicators]]
=== Peer Cache HealthIndicators

The peer `Cache`-based `HealthIndicators` provide additional details specifically for Spring Boot peer cache member
applications. These `HealthIndicators` are available only when the Spring Boot application creates a peer `Cache`
instance.

NOTE: The default cache instance created by Spring Boot for {apache-geode-name} is a `ClientCache` instance.

TIP: To control what type of cache instance is created, such as a "`peer`", you can explicitly declare either the
`@PeerCacheApplication` or, alternatively, the `@CacheServerApplication` annotation on your `@SpringBootApplication`-annotated
class.

[[actuator-peercache-healthindicators-cacheservers]]
==== GeodeCacheServersHealthIndicator

The `GeodeCacheServersHealthIndicator` provides details about the configured {apache-geode-name} `CacheServer` instances.
`CacheServer` instances are required to enable clients to connect to the servers in the cluster.

This `HealthIndicator` captures basic configuration metadata and the runtime behavior and characteristics of
the configured `CacheServer` instances:
