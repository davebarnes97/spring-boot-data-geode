:geode-name: {apache-geode-name}


This section contains working examples that show how to use Spring Boot for {geode-name} (SBDG) effectively.

Some examples focus on specific use cases (such as (HTTP) session state caching), while other examples show how
SBDG works under the hood, to give you a better understanding of what is actually happening and how to debug problems
with your {geode-name}, Spring Boot applications.
